# Drill bit size prediction using CNN

This repo implements a machine learning-based algorithm that can read in a png image file and identify the size of the drill bit displayed in the image.

## Tasks to be done
- Setup
    - vs code [x]
    - git [x]
    - python and jupyter notebooks
- Initial EDA notebook
    - create basic notebook and load videos
    - check dimension
    - check overlap between different videos and see what changes
    - check image similarity techniques
    - basic script to create training data from 1 video
    - script with similarity detection
- Training Data Generation 
    - what should be the training, test, validation folder structure?
    - use the sample from notebook to automate this to all videos
- Training script
    - evaluation metrics
    - what model to use?
